To summarize the assignment (as explained in the document above) 
By the end of class Thursday Week 7 you need a page in your group area entitled: “Workflow Description” .
In this page you should have:
1) A comprehensive explanation of your team’s chosen workflow 
2)  A explanation of its operation
3) What artifacts it will create
Please include all three parts in your explanation.  
Whatever process you use must include the following: 
1. Stories or tasks – Without requirements no project can be implemented. Agile requirements come from stories or required tasks that need to be done to complete the project. 
2. Some manner of estimation - A project cannot be controlled without estimating how long it will run. You have to include some way of estimating the length of the project. Remember: different frameworks use different methods of estimation: Story sizing, Average Cycle Time and individual team member estimates have all been studied as estimation methods. 
3. Product Review – Your framework must include a product review process even if the process is only a team code review.  Some workflows require them at specific times, some only when necessary. When your team performs product reviews depends on how your team implements your framework.
